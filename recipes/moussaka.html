    <h2>Description</h2>
    <a>Moussaka is a layered casserole dish typically made with eggplant (aubergine), minced meat (often lamb or beef), tomatoes, and a creamy béchamel sauce. The dish is seasoned with various herbs and spices such as cinnamon, oregano, and nutmeg, providing a rich and flavorful profile. The layers of eggplant and meat are baked together, creating a hearty and comforting dish that's then topped with a velvety béchamel sauce before being baked to a golden perfection.</a>
